# 3rd party integration

:::info
Creating plugin is not required. You can add a script from any component. But for better structure and code control, we recommend using the plugin
:::

Go to `plugins` directory and create plugin file `x.client.ts`

```ts
export default defineNuxtPlugin((NuxtApp) => {
  useHead({
    script: [
      {
        src: "https://<url>",
        defer: true,
      },
    ],
  });
});
```

Sometimes integration requires adding more complicated js code to the app. In this case, we recommend adding a new module with a component and using it in-app.
